I bulk-installed 27 skills from ECC (Everything Claude Code), added some I found on GitHub, accumulated auto-extracted ones from `/learn`, and wrote my own. Before I knew it, I had 79. **"Where did this skill come from?" — I couldn't tell.**

ECC is a community repository that bundles skills and configurations for Claude Code.

## Why This Is a Problem

When you try to audit your skills by running `ls ~/.claude/skills/`, you see this:

```text
backend-patterns/
coding-standards/
continuous-learning/
iterative-retrieval/
myai-lab-patterns/
nutrient-document-processing/
search-first/
strategic-compact/
...
```

Which ones did you write? Which came from ECC? Which are community-made? Opening the files reveals only `name` and `description` — no provenance information.

This causes real problems in practice:

- **Update decisions**: When ECC releases an update, you don't know which skills to replace
- **Deletion decisions**: You want to remove unused skills, but the criteria differ between self-made and external ones
- **Sharing**: When handing skills to teammates, you can't verify the license or source

## Solution: origin Metadata

I created a rule to add one line of provenance at the top of each skill file.

For files with YAML frontmatter, add it as a field:

```yaml
---
name: coding-standards
description: Universal coding standards...
origin: ECC
---
```

For files without frontmatter, add it as an HTML comment:

```markdown
<!-- origin: original -->
# My Custom Skill
```

## Origin Categories

| origin value | Meaning | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `original` | Self-created | search-first |
| `ECC` | Installed from Everything Claude Code | coding-standards |
| `{org/repo}` | Specific external repository | PSPDFKit-labs/nutrient-agent-skill |
| `auto-extracted` | Auto-extracted by continuous-learning | learned/*.md |
| `skill-create` | Auto-generated from git history | myai-lab-patterns |

## What I Actually Did

I classified and tagged 66 global skills and 13 project-level skills.

### The Matching Process

1. **Identifying ECC skills**: The `configure-ecc/SKILL.md` file contains a list of all 27 skills. I cross-referenced against this to confirm ECC origins
2. **Identifying external repositories**: For skills with no frontmatter clues, I checked file footers and READMEs. `nutrient-document-processing` had the original repository URL at the bottom of the file
3. **Classifying self-made and auto-generated**: Files under `learned/` got `auto-extracted`, those generated by `/skill-create` got `skill-create`, and the rest were `original`

### Breakdown

```text
Skills by origin (79 total):
  ECC             27  — exact match with configure-ecc list
  original        22  — self-made (rules, skills, agents)
  auto-extracted  18  — generated by continuous-learning / /learn
  skill-create     6  — patterns extracted from git history
  external repos   6  — individually found and installed from GitHub
```

The tagging itself was batch-processed with a Python script that detects YAML frontmatter presence and inserts `origin` in the appropriate format.

## Operational Rules

I defined rules in `~/.claude/rules/common/skills.md` so they're automatically applied across all projects:

- **When creating new skills**: Always include origin
- **When installing external skills**: Record the source repository name
- **auto-extracted**: Automatically tagged on skills generated by continuous-learning in `learned/`
- **During audits**: Use origin as the basis for update checks and deletion decisions

## The Underlying Issue

This problem can be solved with personal workflows, but it should really be handled at the ecosystem level.

npm packages have `package.json` with clear provenance, versioning, and licensing. Claude Code skills have no equivalent standard yet. With only `name` and `description` in the frontmatter, management breaks down as skills proliferate.

If `origin`, `version`, and `license` became standard frontmatter metadata, this problem would disappear entirely.

## Filing Issues Upstream

Rather than keeping this as a personal workaround, I proposed improvements upstream:

- **ECC repository**: [affaan-m/everything-claude-code#246](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/issues/246) — Requesting that distributed skills include `origin: ECC`
- **Anthropic**: [anthropics/claude-code#26438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26438) — Requesting a standard metadata specification for skills (origin / version / license)

I submitted to ECC first since the change is small and easier to accept, then linked it as a reference in the Anthropic issue. The goal is to turn a personal workaround into an ecosystem-wide improvement.

## Summary

- Claude Code skills don't record their provenance, making management impossible as numbers grow
- An `origin` metadata field in frontmatter solves this
- Existing skills can be classified by cross-referencing the ECC repository's installer
- Long-term, a standard metadata specification for skills is needed
- Issues have been filed with both ECC and Anthropic

Run `ls ~/.claude/skills/` — if even one result makes you think "what's this?", it's time to add origin tags.
